Hi there!

My name is Andy.

I used to do things, but then I had a couple of babies, so mostly I just try to keep the babies alive and try to keep myself awake.

Here are some videos I made with my friends, when we were young, and could make things.

They’re not… amazing.

A long time ago, I wrote some short stories.

[Dirty Laundry][http://everydayfiction.com/dirty-laundry-by-andrew-leblanc/]

[Event Log][http://everydayfiction.com/event-log-by-andrew-leblanc/] – This one is just about a guy making love to a robot prostitute, from the perspective of the robot’s system log.  People didn’t like it, so I posted these pictures in the comments section, presented here as an animated gif:

I think they liked the picture better.
