There&#8217;s something of a meme going around these here internets, regarding the cooking of delicious butter steaks. I usually hate all internet meme business, but unlike most, this one is fucking delicious.

My friend Dr. Valensky [recently posted](http://www.thebigv.org/blog/) about his own buttersteak adventure, having learned about it [here](http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?/topic/119838-the-best-way-to-cook-a-thick-steak/) and [here](http://thepauperedchef.com/2009/04/the-butter-steak-whats-the-best-way-to-cook-a-steak.html).

Dr. Valensky cooked his steak with margarine. This was a supply failure, rather than an ambitious attempt to subvert butter&#8217;s dominance in the world of delicious steak-frying. I have never purchased margarine in my entire adult cooking life, but its bread-spreading-ease cannot be questioned.

In the spirit of failing to comply with butter-steak cooking practices, I decided to branch out as well. I bought a small filet <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_1/" rel="attachment wp-att-539"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_1-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Filet!" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-539" /></a>  
and I had some leftover bacon from brunch last weekend <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-550"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_2-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="bacon!" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-550" /></a>  
it was time to make: Buttersteak Mignon!

Your pan should be over a little less than medium heat this whole time.

Step one, pre-fry the bacon. Don&#8217;t crisp it up though, otherwise, it will be unwilling to passionately hug your filet. <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_3/" rel="attachment wp-att-547"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_3-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="fry bacon" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-547" /></a>

Step two, in the bacon grease, fry the sides of your filet, not for too long, just long enough that your bacons aren&#8217;t rubbing all up against raw meat. <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_4/" rel="attachment wp-att-559"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_4-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="prep_4" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-559" /></a>

Step three, remove the steak from the pan. Put a few cloves of garlic and a couple tablespoons of butter in the pan, and start frying. Wrap the bacon around the filet. I pinned the bacon to itself with a toothpick. Place it on the pan, and fry it on its edges to crisp up the bacon <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_6/" rel="attachment wp-att-561"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_6-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="prep_6" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-561" /></a>

and then fry each side for five minutes. <a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/prep_5/" rel="attachment wp-att-560"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prep_5-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="prep_5" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-560" /></a>  
From the pictures, it&#8217;s obvious that I did the faces first, and then the edges&#8230; but I think this wasn&#8217;t optimal.

Let it sit for five minutes.

And you&#8217;re done.

Put it on a plate

with a salad  
<a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/salad/" rel="attachment wp-att-568"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/salad-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="salad" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-568" /></a>  
everyone knows steak is more important, though.  
<a href="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/buttersteak-mignon/steak/" rel="attachment wp-att-567"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.criticaloddness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/steak-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="steak" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-567" /></a>

The salad, well. No one cares about salad. 1 cucumber, 1 avocado, handful of parsley, handful of green onions, a handful of mixed greens, red bell pepper, (I would have put tomatoes in it too, but Sandra _hates_ raw tomatoes),salt, pepper, the juice of 1 whole lime, the juice of one whole lemon, a splash of sushi soy sauce, a splash of olive oil. That makes more salad than you see above. Way more. I&#8217;ve been eating that fucking salad for days.

DELICIOUS!
