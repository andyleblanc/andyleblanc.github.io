\*\* Scroll to the bottom of this post for video goodness \*\*

The problem with the way most video cameras render an image is that their sensors are terribly small. The average sensor size is 1/3&#8243;, a tiny fraction of the size of a full super 35 film frame, or even a 16mm film frame. The image captured is essentially a cutout of the image you would see with a larger sensor, for example:

You have the exact same depth compression and depth of field properties with the large sensor, just a smaller view angle. So a wide angle lens for a traditional format becomes a long lens for consumer/prosumer video&#8230; but it still has the geometry and depth of field characteristics of a wide-ass lens. There is a subtle wierdness that comes from this, and many people are able to pick out that material shot on 1/3&#8243; sensors is video, even when the frame rate and shuttor speed and other properties are brought in line with film, although they may not be able to express why.

There [are](http://www.letusdirect.com/) [several](http://www.cinevate.com/) [companies](http://www.redrockmicro.com/) that produce professionally engineered devices to resolve this problem. The trick is to render the lens&#8217;s image on a full sized frame, and then record that frame with the video camera. The frame being recorded by the video camera is 2 dimensional, so the depth of field and geometry characteristics of the video camera&#8217;s ultra-wide lens will have no effect on it.

All of these devices, however, cost well over $1000. So instead, I mounted an old Minolta SLR camera to a piece of wood. And then I ripped the back off of the Minolta, glued the mirror into the open position, and glued a piece of unmarked ground glass where the film frame would normally be.

I then screwed a macro lens to the front of my Canon HV20 so it could focus on this frame right up close, and then I mounted that to the wood as well.

The horrible masking-taped construction paper is to block out light that isn&#8217;t coming from the lens itself&#8230; I really should find a way to make it more attractive.

And the end result, although The Beast itself is ugly, is fairly attractive, I think. I had nothing and no one better to shoot, so I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to watch the family dogs fighting.

And here, without further ado, is The Beast in action:
