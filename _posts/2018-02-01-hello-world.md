Got tired of WordPress.com, Jenny wanted to start her own blog.&nbsp; Figured it was time to spin up a little VM and do some DIY hosting.&nbsp; Even with the 1-Click-Setup-I-Sweat option, it&#8217;s taken me the better part of a day to get this thing working kiiiinda how I want it.&nbsp; Good enough for now, I guess.

Next update in&#8230; roughly two years?
