I&#8217;m a bit stuck. Stuck has a different meaning here. When I&#8217;m stuck on a story written any other month, I can be stuck for weeks, stuck forever. I have written 1,500 words this morning. I stopped writing at 12:08pm. I have been stuck for approximately 16 minutes. The pace is so frantic, and the bar is so low, that stuck and taking a break are interchangeable. I will likely be unstuck sometime after lunch. If nothing appropriate to what has come before comes to mind by then, I will sic some terrible happening unto our heroes, not previously set up, no need for explanation.

Diablo Ex Machina.

Current Word Count: 5,565

Which means that I&#8217;ve crossed the 10% threshold. 10% of the 50,000 goal mark, at any rate. It doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ve gotten 10% of my story down yet. My magnificently bad story. As though Uwe Boll were directing literature.
