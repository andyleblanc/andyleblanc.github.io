I would really like to make the 10,000 mark by bedtime tonight. I think this is a reasonable goal. With any luck, I&#8217;ll be able to nail another 1,000 before lunch, and then I&#8217;ve got until sleep overtakes me to do another 1,500.

I&#8217;m happier with the story now. I like it more. I may even love it, actually.

It&#8217;s still terrible. But I&#8217;m beginning to feel like the mother of an ugly, ill-behaved hoodlum. Sometimes, the best part about something is that it came from somewhere inside of you. And sometimes, that&#8217;s enough.
