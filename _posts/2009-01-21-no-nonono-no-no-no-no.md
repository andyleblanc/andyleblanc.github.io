Here&#8217;s something I hate. Sentences ended with &#8220;,no?&#8221;. It occurs mostly in writing, mostly in e-writing, on the stupid fucking internet.

&#8220;Dark Knight was a great movie, no?&#8221;  
&#8220;Pizza Hut is greasy, no?&#8221;  
&#8220;Being punched in the face is totally rad, no?&#8221;

Here&#8217;s what &#8220;,no?&#8221; translates to: &#8220;amirite?!?&#8221;

Fucking Stop It.

Grow some balls and make a fucking statement, or rewrite your sentence so that it&#8217;s an actual goddamn question.

&#8220;Dark Knight was a great movie.&#8221;  
&#8220;Pizza Hut is greasy.&#8221;  
&#8220;Being punched in the face is totally rad.&#8221;

OR

&#8220;Did you think the Dark Knight was a great movie?&#8221;  
&#8220;How do you feel about the greasy-ness of Pizza Hut pizza?&#8221;  
&#8220;I used to think that being punched in the face was pretty rad, but I&#8217;m having second thoughts; what is your position, apropos a punch in the face?&#8221;

&#8220;,no?&#8221; is lazy fucking writing, and every time I read it, I feel like I&#8217;m being insulted personally. It is simultaneously the mark of a will too weak, too desperate for approval to make a clear, and firm statement, while at the same time too disinterested in the eyes and minds of the sensitive reader to write AN ACTUAL BEARFUCKING QUESTION!

I imagine, in my mind, that anyone who ends a sentence with &#8220;,no?&#8221; sounds exactly like Alyson Hannigan&#8217;s flutist character from American Pie.

Of course, it should be pointed out that the &#8220;,no?&#8221; ending serves a similar function to the Canadian, &#8220;,eh?&#8221;. However, &#8220;,eh?&#8221; has a long cultural history in this great nation, and is a word exactly suited to its purpose. &#8220;No&#8221; is already a word. It already means NO. By using &#8220;no&#8221; in the place of &#8220;eh?&#8221;, one essentially says, &#8220;I&#8217;VE JUST NEGATED MY WHOLE STATEMENT IN THE DESPERATE HOPES THAT YOU WILL REAFFIRM IT!&#8221;

Stop. Stop it you jelly-spined crybabies.
