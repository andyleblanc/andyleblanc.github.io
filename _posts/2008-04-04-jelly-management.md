I have the kind of body type where everyone assumes that I&#8217;ve lost weight.

I don&#8217;t know what this means.

Let&#8217;s say, for example, that I haven&#8217;t changed my net mass in approximately six months. Let&#8217;s say I last saw you five months ago. Let&#8217;s say I saw you today. You&#8217;ll say, statistically proven, without fail, &#8220;Holy shit, you&#8217;ve lost weight!&#8221;.

I haven&#8217;t been able to figure this out. I am able to predict it, clockwork precise. Why? How does this happen?

I need to keep my jelly in check. I am aware of my own jelly. I am aware of the jelly reduction that common sense demands.

But anyone I haven&#8217;t seen since at least February: &#8220;You&#8217;ve already reduced your jelly! You are a jelly reducing machine!&#8221;

But there is no jelly reduction. I weigh the exact same. There is something about my body type.

I posess some kind of nostalgia fatness. Some kind of fatness where people remember me fatter than I really am. Such that, even if I&#8217;m still kind of fat, people are all like, &#8220;Holy shit, you&#8217;ve lost weight.&#8221; It&#8217;s wierd.

Wierd science.

It&#8217;s kind of&#8230; demotivating.
