I write with great irregularity. Unlike dear Ham, I cannot post works for criticism, unless they&#8217;ve already been published at some linkable location. Otherwise, publishers will be all like, &#8220;Your shit is worthless, it&#8217;s already out there in open cyber-space where anybody can get it.&#8221;

Instead, this will be a chronicle of all the things I do to avoid writing. I avoid writing regularly. 

And guilt. I will also chronicle my guilt. And a running word count, of words properly fictional written since my last post. 

This is my first post. That&#8217;s why the number is zero.

Fictional Words Written Since Last Post: 0
