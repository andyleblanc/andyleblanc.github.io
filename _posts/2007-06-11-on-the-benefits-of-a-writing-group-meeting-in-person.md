Writing group meets in person today, as opposed to the usual MSN Messenger thing. This happens every couple of months or so. I prefer the in person meetings for two reasons. The first is that we almost always manage to get more accomplished; all communication seems to become a little clearer (even for writers, sometimes instant messaging just doesn&#8217;t cut it). The second and most important reason is that near where we meet there is a coffee shop that sells enourmous slices of a very high quality carrot cake with real cream cheese icing at an affordable price. Delicious. And filling. 

One might argue that &#8220;filling&#8221; is not necessarily a desirable quality in a dessert. In this particular case, I disagree.
