So. A badly botched wisdom tooth extraction when I was 18 led me to avoid dental care for approximately 8 years. The previously posted wisdom tooth picture was the first, and biggest price paid for my hiatus. As of today&#8217;s drilling, I am now officially caught up&#8230; the political environment of my mouth has been stabilized by a popular new government.

I tried to drink some coffee too soon after the dental work, and my frozen mouth drooled it all over my sweater. I guess this is what I have to look forward to when I get old.
